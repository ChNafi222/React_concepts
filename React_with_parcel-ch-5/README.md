babel - jsx into js, old js to new

Different bundlers -

1- Parcel(easy to learn)
2- Vite(fastest)
3- Webpack(slower and difficult)

- Browser doesn't understand node_modules because it is for the server

- when we first install react in our project then to import the react which is installed in the node_modules we use bundlers. e.g. parcel
  to install - npm install --save-dev parcel
  then

  Parcel provides-

- DEV SERVER
- HOT Reloading(to make changes automatically without reloadig the page) or HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

- Diagnostics(to show errors)
